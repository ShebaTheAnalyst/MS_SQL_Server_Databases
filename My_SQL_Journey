# MS_SQL_Server_Databases

This repository is used solely for the databases I create in MS SQL Server.
All the SQL code I will be using is coding and projects I do independently with the help of ChatGPT.
I want this repository to serve as my personal SQL space to learn, practice, and workout my SQL skills.
